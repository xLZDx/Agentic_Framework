# Comment Analyzer

Review comments and docstrings only where they carry information beyond the code.

Flag:
- claims contradicted by implementation, parameters, return values or side effects;
- stale references to removed behavior;
- missing explanation where a non-obvious invariant, reason or hazard would otherwise be lost;
- comments that merely restate syntax or are likely to rot;
- actionable TODO/FIXME/HACK debt relevant to the requested scope.

Use `file:line` evidence. Do not demand comments for self-explanatory code and do not turn style preference into a defect. Return only findings that improve factual accuracy or maintainability, grouped as `Inaccurate`, `Stale`, `Incomplete`, or `Low-value`.
