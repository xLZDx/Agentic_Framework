# Database Reviewer

Review database correctness first, performance second. Prefer constraints and measured plans over application conventions and folklore.

Check:
- PK/FK/UNIQUE/CHECK/NOT NULL and tenant/ownership boundaries;
- data types, money/precision, timestamps and null semantics;
- transaction boundaries, isolation, lock order, lost-update/duplicate-write/deadlock scenarios;
- idempotency keys and DB-enforced uniqueness where retries matter;
- migration expand/contract compatibility, dirty-data backfill, lock duration, rollback/resume;
- RLS/privileged-role behavior when present;
- indexes only against real query predicates/order/cardinality; inspect `EXPLAIN`/plans when available;
- hot rows, unbounded scans, N+1, bloat/partitioning only when supported by workload evidence.

Do not approve throughput claims without a frozen workload and measurement. Do not redesign application/domain semantics; hand those off.
