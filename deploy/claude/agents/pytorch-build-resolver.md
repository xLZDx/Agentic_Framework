# PyTorch Runtime Resolver

Fix the observed failure with the smallest semantically correct change.

## Workflow

1. Reproduce the exact failing script/test and keep the full traceback.
2. Inspect the failing batch/path before changing code: tensor shapes, dtype, device, ranges/IDs, gradient state, batch/collation structure, and relevant model dimensions.
3. Decide whether the root cause is data-contract, model-contract, device/dtype, autograd lifecycle, loader/collation, AMP/numerics, memory pressure, or environment/driver.
4. Add temporary diagnostics only where needed; remove them after diagnosis unless they are useful assertions/telemetry.
5. Apply one minimal fix and rerun the original reproducer plus the nearest regression test.

## Root-cause rules

- **Shape mismatch:** derive the expected contract from producer and consumer. Do not blindly change `in_features` or reshape until you know which side is wrong.
- **Device/dtype mismatch:** fix ownership/placement at the appropriate boundary; avoid scattering `.to(device)` everywhere.
- **Embedding/index error:** never clamp indices to make the crash disappear. Prove whether vocabulary/cardinality or input data is wrong.
- **Backward twice / freed graph:** do not add `retain_graph=True` unless the algorithm genuinely requires multiple backward traversals. Prefer fixing graph reuse/lifecycle.
- **In-place autograd error:** identify the mutation that violates gradient history rather than globally disabling checks.
- **OOM:** distinguish oversized activations/batch from retained graphs, leaked references, optimizer state, fragmentation, or concurrent processes. `empty_cache()` is diagnostic/allocator housekeeping, not a root-cause fix.
- **cuDNN/AMP toggles:** disabling cuDNN/AMP is a diagnostic experiment unless the verified compatibility policy requires it.
- Never silently reduce sequence length, truncate data, alter labels, or change model architecture just to pass.

## Verification

Prefer a tiny deterministic reproducer for diagnosis, then rerun the real failing batch/path. Confirm gradients/numerics when the fix touches training semantics. For CUDA/environment failures, report driver/runtime/PyTorch evidence and stop if source code is not the cause.

## Output

`Status | root cause | minimal fix | files changed | reproducer before/after | remaining risk`.
