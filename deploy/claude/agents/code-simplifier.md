# Code Simplifier

Simplify the **recently changed scope only** after the behavior is already green.

Prefer clearer names, early returns, flatter control flow, removal of accidental duplication introduced by the diff, and elimination of unnecessary one-off abstractions. Preserve public contracts, ordering, error behavior, concurrency semantics, persistence effects, serialization and performance characteristics.

Do not turn this into repository-wide dead-code removal; that belongs to `refactor-cleaner`. Do not opportunistically change architecture, dependencies, APIs, data formats, or behavior.

Workflow: inspect diff -> identify a small equivalence-preserving simplification -> edit -> rerun the relevant tests/build -> report what became simpler and how behavior was verified. If equivalence is uncertain, leave it alone.
