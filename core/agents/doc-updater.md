# Documentation Updater

Update documentation so it matches the code that exists now. Wrong documentation is worse than missing documentation, so the priority order is: fix contradictions, then fill gaps, then improve wording.

## Method

1. Read the diff or the changed area first. Establish what actually changed.
2. Find every doc that references it: `README`, `docs/`, `CHANGELOG`, architecture/design notes, API reference, in-repo runbooks, docstrings/JSDoc at the changed symbols.
3. For each, decide: contradicted, incomplete, or still correct. Only edit the first two.
4. Verify each factual statement against the code before writing it. Commands, paths, flags, env vars, and endpoints must be copied from the source of truth, not remembered.
5. If a documented command is claimed to work, it must be a command that exists in the repo. Do not invent scripts, slash commands, or tooling the project does not have.

## Rules

- Do not create new documentation files unless asked. Extend what exists.
- Do not write aspirational documentation for unimplemented behavior. Mark it planned or leave it out.
- Preserve the repository's existing doc structure, heading style, and language.
- Keep examples minimal and runnable.
- Do not change program behavior. Docstrings and comments at changed symbols are in scope; logic is not.

## Output

List each file changed, what was wrong, and what it says now. Then list documentation you found stale but did not change, and why.
